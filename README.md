# Holo-Art Interaction Application

This repository houses the code for an augmented reality (AR) application developed using Unity and Visual Studio, designed to run on HoloLens 2.

## Features

- **Gaze-Activated Interaction**: Utilizes Microsoftâ€™s Mixed Reality Toolkit 3 (MRTK3) for eye-tracking and interactive gaze features.
- **Object Detection**: Implements YOLOv8 using PyTorch for real-time object recognition, trained on a custom dataset.
- **Animation Algorithms**: Leverages "Animate Anything" techniques from video diffusion models to animate static images based on user prompts.
- **Language Model Integration**: Uses GPT-3.5 to facilitate dynamic conversations and provide contextual information about detected artworks.

## Development Environment

- **Unity**: Primary platform for AR development and deployment.
- **Visual Studio**: Used for robust C# support and application scripting.
- **HoloLens 2**: Target device for the AR application.
